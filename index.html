                       I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, if not more so, 
                       in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny’s worth.

                       “ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been looking to make a 
                         transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up 
                         for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. 
                         The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing 
                         the course, I’ve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”

                       “ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of code. I needed some structure from 
                         professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former 
                         student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff 
                         did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team 
                         project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial 
                         could ever have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent 
                         experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 
                         100% recommend! ”
